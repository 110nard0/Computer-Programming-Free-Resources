# :pirate_flag: Roadmap of Free Resources for Aspiring TechBrosâ„¢
This is my personal roadmap to starting a tech career from scratch with free resources.
It will be updated as I advance in my career and draws influence from the multitude of available online resources.
I hope it helps you as it has helped me.

## :lollipop: Preamble
Initially, I had a VERY hard time putting this together because I felt no one would want to hear from a newbie about how to kick off a whole career. 
Then I started asking myself what I had to offer when there are literally millions of resources out there, each one recommended by the next person. 
I eventually decided to ignore the billions of people who did not have any legitimate reason to listen to me and focus on my four or five friends 
who I had long promised a definitive bank of resources. By reducing my scope, I was able to squeeze out all the fluff and produce a list I can swear by, 
anyday, anytime.  
This one is for you.

## :airplane: Ready, Set, Go
The purpose of this is to document **free** resources I used to kickstart my tech journey.  
Starting out, I spent most of my time going through hundreds of recommended resources and found most of them to be sub-par. 
I was suffering from paralysis of analysis (i don't know where the origin of this term but it is so cool) without knowing it. 
In order for that not to be a total waste of hours, I want to cut straight to the chase and share the resources I believe to be the most
vital for those just starting out.

### Okay, Backpedal
Now, I know I said I would get to the heart of the matter but there are a few sections we have to cover as I believe them to be more
vital to n00bs like us than immediately opening a programming tutorial or book and starting to download information without a strong foundation.  
I will present this matter-of-factly for sake of brevity.
Let's begin.

### Why am I qualified to write this?
- Because in many ways, I am still a beginner myself and I still understand how hard it is to start something 
AKA looking at a blank screen on your code editor and going `WTFWTFWTFWTFWTF` till you close your laptop and go watch anime.  
Yeah, me too.  
- There is too much information out there so I am going to give you the minimum viable number of resources needed per topic so you can hit the ground 
running. I will also share links to more resources than you will ever need, so relax.
- The tech scene has had a subtle change over the years and most of the guides do not reflect current reality.
- Most importantly, I believe in always knowing the fundamentals. There will be an obvious bias toward having Computer Science knowledge even though
this is more of a programming guide but I do not believe one can exist without the other. 

### Who is this for?
- You are chronically confused over which tech field to join.
- You have been watching tech tutorials for years but are now stuck.
- You have been bouncing between different programming languages and stacks for a while.
- You don't have the first clue of what to do or where to start. Tech? Stack? WTF are those.
- You have a general sense of awe or love for computers or technology but have never ventured deeper.
- You like money and/or are willing to learn **anything** for work. Possessing a _strong drive_ can suffice in place of liking money.
- You think you are not smart enough or do not know enough math.
- You think you are too old to learn how to code.
- You do not know what to do with your life.
- You are a gifted kid with burnout.
- ...

### This is NOT for you if...?
- You already have a path in your head that you think works. Do you, boo.
- You have chosen a tech stack (data, design, networking) and are committed to it. 
- You have chosen a programming language and are committed to sticking it through.
- You hate learning.

### CAVEAT
1. Everything I share here is a result of being broke and the search for free things. I will only post **1** link to a paid course because it is 
ABSOLUTELY important. I would advocate for a torrent download but if you can sacrifice a week/month of your favorite vice and save up for this course, 
you will **DEFINITELY** have more "ginger" to finish it. There is no greater motivator to do something than investing in it. 
(Look at me giving you advice and sh...)

2. All these resources are what I used, so they may not be your style. I majorly avoid YouTube tutorials except for introductory lessons. I prefer reading. 
I love gamified learning.
Please, if that is not you, look at the bottom of the page for the guides I found helpful and curate your roadmap to your taste. However, rest assured 
that the quality of every material here is top-notch because I also like shiny things.  
TL,DR: YMMV, DYOR.


## :brain: Mindset
Your mind[set] is the single most important thing you need to work on before and after you start learning how to code.  
I will be updating this section as I come across more links but for now, let's start with these:

- #### Learning to Learn
  It is important that you go through these two courses, even if you do not buy them or apply for financial aid to access the full versions with 
  assignments and a certificate. I cannot overstate how important they were in opening my eyes to what exactly I wanted to do with my brain, and 
  undoing the damage of the traditional school system. Okay, I'll shut up now.  
  
  1. [Learning How to Learn](https://coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn)  
  2. [Mindshift](https://coursera.org/learn/mindshift)  

  No, seriously, take them. This is the first step.

- #### Growth Mindset & Grit
  1. Please watch _every_ video and read _every_ article linked on this [page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-motivation-and-mindset).
  I cannot stress this enough.  
  2. [No Zero Days](https://www.reddit.com/r/NonZeroDay/comments/1qbxvz/the_gospel_of_uryans01_helpful_advice_for_anyone/). Excellent advice methinks.

### Which programming language should I learn?

If like me, once upon a time, you are stuck asking yourself this question, **YOU ARE MISSING THE POINT**. And wasting time too.  
A programming language is just a tool used to create something or solve a problem using complex machinery.  
Read that again.   
The specific language you use is mostly irrelevant if your problem is solved in the end.  
In fact, the best way to learn coding is to think of a problem, Google a solution and learn whatever language offers the best, simplest
or most elegant solution. That's it.


However, we are not in fantasy land and you need facts, so the path I recommend the most is **Web Development**. Why?:
- It is the perfect introduction to programming because it is very visual and you are already familiar with the web.
- Its concepts are fairly easier to understand. You are coming from a non-tech background. Let's not make it harder for you.
- You can easily decide which path to branch into after learning web development. By then you will be knowledgeable enough to make an informed choice.
- HTML and CSS do not have control flow so you do not need bother about algorithms till you reach JavaScript.  

I ruined it by mentioning weird terms at the end, didn't I? Well, at this point you're ready to dive into the deep end so LFG!!


## :bus: Last Bus Stop
Before you go on to my roadmap, you should read this:
- [Getting Started in Tech for Nigerians](https://medium.com/one-zero/a-nigerians-guide-to-a-career-in-tech-cdeaac6fd79a).  

I will not be defining any terms here so I am going to lazily link 
[this](https://medium.com/@meekg33k/getting-started-in-tech-what-you-need-to-know-7efec043ce03) and 
[this](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-kickstart-a-career-in-tech/).  

Computer Science vs Computer Engineering? Programming vs Coding? Frontend vs Backend? Just [Google](https://www.google.com) it.  
There are 1001 in base 10 definitions, and after enough time, either you get the hang of it or the differences cease to matter.

### Important References
These are resources you should definitely look into and save as bookmarks. They will serve as a useful guide on your path, even more than this one you 
are reading. I know I feel that way.
- This amazing [Github repository](https://github.com/bmorelli25/Become-A-Full-Stack-Web-Developer) on how to level up as a fullstack web developer. I 
particularly like this [section](https://github.com/bmorelli25/Become-A-Full-Stack-Web-Developer#what-is-the-single-most-useful-cs-bookmark-you-have) 
and this [section](https://github.com/bmorelli25/Become-A-Full-Stack-Web-Developer#games-and-challenge-websites) but you should start from the [beginning](https://github.com/bmorelli25/Become-A-Full-Stack-Web-Developer#start-here), obviously.
- These detailed [Roadmaps](https://roadmap.sh/)! Start exploring [here](https://roadmap.sh/frontend).  
These two have basically all you need in a roadmap.  
- The [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science#curriculum) Computer Science curriculum which I plan to go through at some point. Any takers?


## :rocket: Takeoff
From this point on, I will be shoving courses and tutorials in your face. I hope you're ready.  
Here are some pointers (based on my mistakes):
- Please, try and take it a course at a time. Optimize for focus and attention over completion.
- There is no speed limit so you can go as fast or as slow as you need; the point is to *understand the fundamentals*.
- Practice is 100% better than memorization. You learn by **failing** and **doing**. You'll find this out soon enough.
- I will be arranging them in the order I *wish* I had taken them in, not in the order I took them. I did this because I now understand the flow and can 
better see the link between topics. I advice you do same. Knowledge builds upon knowledge. 
- All courses on edX and Coursera have a free version but you can apply for financial aid or to be an auditor to get access to assignments and certificates. 
That is not totally necessary. Be on the lookout for scholarships from companies too, they are always flying around.
- Do more research and find more resources than these, as long as you are committed to finishing those on this page.  
- These are not the alpha and omega for learning. They are resources that left a lasting, good impression. I am only able to say this because I have spent 
a longer period of time going through a lot more of them.
- Be flexible! You can mix and match as long as you keep moving forward, in a positive direction.
- You can do this. Period. End of story. The questions is, _do you want to?_  

### :computer: Introduction to Programming and Computer Science
This section is **non-negotiable**.
- [CS50T on edX](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-understanding-technology)
- [freeCodeCamp on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOjov-2OZ0E&vl=en)
- [CS50x on edX](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x)
- [Google IT Support:](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-it-support) Great to have if you have zero computer experience but you may 
move on to the next section while taking it ONLY if you are done with the previous three.

### :globe_with_meridians: Fullstack Web Development
#### HTML & CSS
- [Interneting is Hard:](https://www.internetingishard.com/) Start here. Teaches the basics of web dev and makes your life easier down the line.
- [The Web Developer Bootcamp:](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) This is the paid course. It is the backbone of everything you will 
learn and complements freeCodeCamp nicely with thoughtful explanations. Invest.
- [freeCodeCamp:](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/) Start from the top, with the new Responsive Web Design curriculum. Do not 
run away from the projects. This is the most vital resource on here because there is just so much content besides the website challenges: 
blog, forum, podcast, even a music radio.
- [The Odin Project:](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths) I found this after freeCodeCamp. They do almost the same thing but where fCC teaches extensively 
and gives projects, these guys teach fundamentals then point you to outside resources. While doing fCC projects, I check in here every now and then to 
revise topics and/or hunt resources on what I am currently learning. Do not throw it away but do not bother with every single project if you are doing fCC's 
as well. 
- [Frontend Mentor:](https://www.frontend-mentor.io/challenges) Start this once you are done with freeCodeCamp's responsive web design challenges.

#### JavaScript
Now, you are learning your first programming language. You should have completed all 5 freeCodeCamp projects at least.  
If not, go back [here](https://github.com/110nard0/Software-Engineering-Free-Roadmap#html--css). If yes, proceed...
- [Modern JavaScript Tutorial:](https://javascript.info/) I really like this online tutorial. Most of the links in the Odin Project JS sections redirect to 
this site. I find the method of delivery to be a balance of theory and tasks, which is ideal for learning and recall.
- [freeCodeCamp:](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/) fCC's JS challenges. _Will update once I complete the challenges._

#### Tools, Libraries, Frameworks
- [freeCodeCamp:](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/) _Will update once I complete the challenges._
- Get comfortable using Git and Githubw. Consult Project Odin's [resources](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-introduction-to-git) 
and the official [documentation](https://git-scm.com/book). I also found Pluralsight's videos on the topic better than any Youtube video.
- Practice CSS design with Bootstrap. If you are not there yet, [learn](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/).


## :bell: Dev Resources
Important resources you will need on your journey.
### General Resources
- [Git Branching:](http://learngitbranching.js.org/) One of my favorite gamified resources out there.
- [Pluralsight:](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/) Their introductory courses are a good alternative to Youtube tutorials. Look out for the GADS scholarship.

### Frontend Resources
- [MDN:](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn) Invaluable resource for web developers.
- [CSS Tricks:](https://css-tricks.com/) Pot-of-gold at the end of the CSS rainbow.
- [Flexbox Froggy:](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) Another of my favorite gamified resources.

### Backend Resources

## :people_hugging: Closing
I intentionally left out a ~~bunch~~ ton of stuff in order not to overwhelm you. The most important thing to do is **_start_**. Start now. Start scared. Start
before you know what you are doing. Just start. The rest will come and it will get easier with time, I promise. It may feel like nothing is happening for the 
longest time but keep moving forward, knowledge compounds. I cannot wait for you to ask me for even more resources.  
**Ganbare!**

**P.S.** Yes, joining a community is absolutely important. You can start from hanging out on tech twitter and attending dev meetups.  
Pro tip: If it is too hard, start your own.
